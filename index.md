<div style="text-align: justify"> This project is to apply optimization algorithms and techniques for stock investment. Our investment team will choose 40 stocks to invest and only consider buying or selling these stocks during the three-year-long investment period. The decision of buying and selling will based on the result of scenario tree with the predication on the economy of the United States and the network optimization to maximize the total revenue generated from the stock investment portfolio. Finally, there will be eight investment portfolios for different conditions and predictions. At the same time, to lower the risk, the stocks to be chosen are divides into two groups: better performance in good economy (positive beta compared to SP500 index-SPY) (Group 1) and better performance in bad economy (negative beta compared to SPY) (Group 2).</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">This is my team project in <strong>FIN642</strong>: Business Conditions and Forecasting course, which covers comprehensive and state-of-the-art forecasting methods applied to the business world. We investigates the factors that affect exchange rate movements between USD and CNY and makes forecasting for future USD/CNY exchange rate.
  
The techniques we used includes various time series analyses such as ARIMA and Holt-Winters exponential smoothing and econometric modeling. The time series analysis suggests that the exchange rate change follows an autoregressive model using data from the most recent time period. The evidence from the regression model indicates that the change in exchange rate is positively correlated with the  change in forward premium of the most recent time period. The root of mean squared error suggests that the time series model outperforms the regression model. </div>
